                <p> As part of our 25th anniversary celebrations, ANDES would like to thank 
                    everyone who has contributed to institutional development, collaborative research 
                    and knowledge sharing. We appreciate the encouragement of partners along the way 
                    and look forward to continuing our partnerships as we move forward with the 
                    implementation of Yachay Kuychi Pluriversity. There are too many people to name here, 
                    but we have chosen to highlight 25 influencers from ANDES's 25-year history.

                        Alejandro Argumedo and Cesar Argumedo grew up in the center of the Andes in Peru with their 4
                        brothers. After high school, Alejandro studied agronomy at McGill University in
                        Montreal, Canada, and Cesar studied zootechnology at the San Antonio Abad University of Cusco,
                        Peru.

                        Sustainable (ANDES) in Cusco. During the first years, the organization operated with funds
                        very limited and understaffed. However, during this period important
                        relationships that led to the establishment of the iconic Potato Park by 6 communities
                        indigenous people with the ANDES guide. This work continues to provide important lessons and
                        a model for most of the current work in organizations.
